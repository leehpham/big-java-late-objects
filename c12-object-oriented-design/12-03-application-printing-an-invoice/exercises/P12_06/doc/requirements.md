# Requirements
- [x] It is the original problem statement.
- [x] For now, all the problems only contain 2 operands.
- [x] Bug: since this is a console app, use a Single Scanner to read from System.in. So, I must move the getting user input functionality somewhere else (to the main program). I'll deal with this later. 
- [ ] Add a Campaign class that is responsible for the logics that controll Level. This also simplifies the GameDriver.
