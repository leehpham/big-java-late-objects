1: how to simplify inputs?
- Remove the first character.
2: turn solutions for smaller inputs into a solution for original problem
- Remove the first character then call the method on the shorter string. Then concatenate the retun value with the first character at the end.
3: find solutions for the simplest inputs:
- Calling the method on a string with length 1 returns the string itself (a 1-character string is also its reverse)
4: Implement the solution
