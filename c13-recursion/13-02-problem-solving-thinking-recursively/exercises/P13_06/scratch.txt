1: how to simplify the inputs?
- Remove the first character.
2: combine solutions for simpler inputs into a solution
- If the substring at the beginning of the text matches, return true. If not, remove the first character, then call the method on the smaller 
3: find solutions to the simplest inputs.
- When the smaller text's length is equal to the target string's length:
    - if they are equal, return true
    - if they are not, return false
4: implement the solution
